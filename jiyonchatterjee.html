  <h1>Why Manchester United is the best football club of all time:</h1>
    <h2><i>By Jiyon Chatterjee</i><h2>
      <h3><u>Players</u><h3>
  <p>The Red Devils have the highest number of Ballon D'Or winners out of any English club, with 4 winners in our player history: Denis Law in 1964, Sir Bobby Charlton in 1966, George Best in 1968, and Cristiano Ronaldo in 2008. United has been recognized as the gold standard for producing world class players, with club greats such as David Beckham, Ryan Giggs, Wayne Rooney, and Paul Scholes emphasizing what it means to be a legendary footballer.</p>
      
        <h3><u>Trophies</u></h3>
        <p>Manchester United have won more trophies than any other club in English football, with a record 20 League titles, 12 FA Cups, five League Cups and a record 21 FA Community Shields. United have also won three European Cups/UEFA Champions Leagues, one UEFA Europa League, one UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, one UEFA Super Cup, one Intercontinental Cup and one FIFA Club World Cup. In 1998–99, the club became the first in the history of English football to achieve the continental European treble. By winning the UEFA Europa League in 2016–17, they became one of only five clubs to have won all three main UEFA club competitions.</p>
